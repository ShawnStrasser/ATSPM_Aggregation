--Aggregate Pedestiran Services, Actuations, Unique Actuations
--MUST BE RUN OVER MULTIPLE TIME PERIODS FOR VOLUMES TO WORK!
--Uses a rolling 15-minute window, data at the end is cut off or distorted. So for example run over a day and 11:15pm-midnight will be cut off.
--Written in SQL for DuckDB. This is a jinja2 template, with variables inside curly braces.

--The intention of "unique" actuations is that back-to-back actuations from the same person are removed
--The default time lapse before a new unique actuation for a given ped phase may be counted is 15 seconds
--see this study: https://doi.org/10.1177/0361198121994126
