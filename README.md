# Detector Health
This is still a work in progress. Please reach out with any questions: shawn.strasser@odot.oregon.gov

This project is to extract meaningful insights from hi-res traffic signal data (stored in SQL Server) and from vehicle probe data from RITIS/INRIX. First, data is download from SQL/RITIS, and the stored locally in parquet files. From there the data can be loaded, transformed, and mined for insights.

This will initially be limited to anomaly detection for vehicle detector actuations and vehicle probe data, but will be expanded.
