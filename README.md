# Traffic Signal Performance Measure Aggregation
This is still a work in progress. Please reach out with any questions: shawn.strasser@odot.oregon.gov

The purpose of this project is to extract traffic signal performance measures (ATSPMs) from hi-res ATC controller data and from vehicle probe data from RITIS/INRIX.
